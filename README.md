# Code-Analyzer
A learning tool to get an overview on the student's coding progress utilising snippets of code taken during a coding session.
This application uses Python as its backend, making use of several libraries like flask and subprocess as well as Python methods like Pylint and Radon to judge the code in a particular snippet.
The front-end was created using HTML and CSS and linked with the backend using API endpoints.
